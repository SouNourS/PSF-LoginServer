  * Exploration:<br>
  * `seq_time` appears to be used in other message definitions as well.
  * It seems to represent a timestamp for ordering, e.g., player and weapon events.
  * @param avatar_guid the player's GUID
  * @param pos where the player is in the world
  * @param vel how the player is moving
  * @param facingYaw the angle with respect to the horizon towards which the avatar is looking;
  *                  the model's whole body is facing this direction;
  *                  measurements are counter-clockwise from East
  * @param facingPitch the angle with respect to the sky and the ground towards which the avatar is looking
  * @param facingYawUpper the angle of the avatar's upper body with respect to its forward-facing direction
  * @param seq_time na
  * @param unk1 na
  * @param is_crouching avatar is crouching
  * @param is_jumping avatar is jumping;
  *                   must remain flagged for jump to maintain animation
  * @param jump_thrust provide a measure of vertical stability when really close to the avatar character
  * @param is_cloaked avatar is cloaked by virtue of an Infiltration Suit
  * @param unk2 na
  * @param unk3 na
