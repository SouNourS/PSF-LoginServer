/**
  * The basic compiled tasks for assigning (registering) and revoking (unregistering) globally unique identifiers.<br>
  * <br>
  * Almost all of these functions will be invoked from `WorldSessionActor`.
  * Some of the "unregistering" functions will invoke on delayed `Service` operations,
  * indicating behavior that is not user/observer dependent.
  * The object's (current) `Zone` must also be knowable since the GUID systems are tied to individual zones.
  * For simplicity, all functions have the same format where the hook into the GUID system is an `implicit` parameter.
  * It will get passed from the more complicated functions down into the less complicated functions,
  * until it has found the basic number assignment functionality.<br>
  * <br>
  * All functions produce a `TaskResolver.GiveTask` container object that is expected to be used by a `TaskResolver`.
  * These "task containers" can also be unpackaged into their tasks, sorted into other containers,
  * and combined with other "task containers" to enact more complicated sequences of operations.
