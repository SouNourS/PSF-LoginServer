  * A server object representing the one-landmass planets as well as the individual subterranean caverns.<br>

  * The concept of a "zone" is synonymous to the common vernacular "continent,"
  * commonly referred by names such as Hossin or Ishundar and internally identified as c2 and c7, respectively.
  * A `Zone` is composed of the abstracted concept of all the information pertinent for the simulation of the environment.
  * That is, "everything about the continent."
  * Physically, server objects and dynamic game objects are maintained through a local unique identifier system.
  * Static server objects originate from the `ZoneMap`.
  * Dynamic game objects originate from player characters.
  * (Write more later.)
  * @param zoneId the privileged name that can be used as the second parameter in the packet `LoadMapMessage`
  * @param zoneMap the map of server objects upon which this `Zone` is based
  * @param zoneNumber the numerical index of the `Zone` as it is recognized in a variety of packets;
  *                   also used by `LivePlayerList` to indicate a specific `Zone`
  * @see `ZoneMap`<br>
