  * The process of "construction" and "initialization" and "configuration" are referenced at this level.

  * "Construction" and "instantiation" of the cluster merely produces the "facade" of the different `Zone` entities.
  * In such a `List`, every built `Zone` is capable of being a destination on the "Intercontinental lattice."
  * "Initialization" and "configuration" of the cluster refers to the act of completing the "Intercontinental Lattice"
  * by connecting different terminus warp gates together.
  * Other activities involve event management and managing wide-reaching and factional attributes.
