/**
  * The base class for a type of "destruction `Actor`" intended to be used for delaying object cleanup activity.
  * Objects submitted to this process should be registered to a global unique identified system for a given region
  * as is specified in their submission.<br>
  * <br>
  * Two waiting lists are used to pool the objects being removed.
  * The first list is a basic pooling list that precludes any proper removal actions
  * and is almost expressly for delaying the process.
  * Previously-submitted tasks can be removed from this list so long as a matching object can be found.
  * Tasks in this list can also be expedited into the second list without having to consider delays.
  * After being migrated to the secondary list, the object is considered beyond the point of no return.
  * Followup activity will lead to its inevitable unregistering and removal.<br>
  * <br>
  * Functions have been provided for `override` in order to interject the appropriate cleanup operations.
  * The activity itself is typically removing the object in question from a certain list,
  * dismissing it with a mass distribution of `ObjectDeleteMessage` packets,
  * and finally unregistering it.
  * Some types of object have (de-)implementation variations which should be made explicit through the overrides.
