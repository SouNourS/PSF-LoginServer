/**
  * Maintain and curate a list of timed `vehicle` object deconstruction tasks.<br>
  * <br>
  * These tasks are queued or dismissed by player activity but they are executed independent of player activity.
  * A common disconnected cause of deconstruction is neglect for an extended period of time.
  * At that point, the original owner of the vehicle no longer matters.
  * Deconstruction neglect, however, is averted by having someone become seated.
  * A realized deconstruction is entirely based on a fixed interval after an unresolved request has been received.
  * The actual process of deconstructing the vehicle and cleaning up its resources is performed by an external agent.<br>
  * <br>
  * This `Actor` is intended to sit on top of the event system that handles broadcast messaging.
