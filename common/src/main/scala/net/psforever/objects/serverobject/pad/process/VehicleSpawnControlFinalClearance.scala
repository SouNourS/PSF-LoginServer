/**
  * An `Actor` that handles vehicle spawning orders for a `VehicleSpawnPad`.
  * The basic `VehicleSpawnControl` is the root of a simple tree of "spawn control" objects that chain to each other.
  * Each object performs on (or more than one related) actions upon the vehicle order that was submitted.<br>
  * <br>
  * There is nothing left to do
  * except make certain that the vehicle has moved far enough away from the spawn pad
  * to not block the next order that may  be queued.
  * A long call is made to the root of this `Actor` object chain to start work on any subsequent vehicle order.
  * @param pad the `VehicleSpawnPad` object being governed
