/**
  * A slot "on the player" into which an implant is installed.<br>
  * <br>
  * In total, players have three implant slots.
  * At battle rank one (BR1), however, all of those slots are locked.
  * The player earns implants at BR16, BR12, and BR18.
  * A locked implant slot can not be used.
  * (The code uses "not yet unlocked" logic.)
  * When unlocked, an implant may be installed into that slot.<br>
  * <br>
  * The default implant that the underlying slot utilizes is the "Range Magnifier."
  * Until the `Installed` condition is some value other than `None`, however, the implant in the slot will not work.
