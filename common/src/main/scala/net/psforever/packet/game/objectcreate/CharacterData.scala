/**
  * A part of a representation of the avatar portion of `ObjectCreateMessage` packet data.
  * This densely-packed information outlines most of the specifics of depicting some other character.<br>
  * <br>
  * The character created by this data is treated like an NPC from the perspective of the server.
  * Someone else decides how that character is behaving and the server tells each client how to depict that behavior.
  * For that reason, the character is mostly for presentation purposes, rather than really being fleshed-out.
  * (As far as the client is concerned, nothing stops this character from being declared an "avatar."
  * A player would find such a client-controlled character lacking many important details and have poor equipment.
  * They would also be competing with some other player for input control, if they could control the character at all.)<br>
  * <br>
  * Divisions exist to make the data more manageable.
  * The first division of data only manages the general appearance of the player's in-game model.
  * The second division (currently, the fields actually in this class) manages the status of the character.
  * In general, it passes more simplified data about the character, the minimum that is necessary to explain status to some other player.
  * For example, health and armor are percentages, and are depicted as bars over the player's head near the nameplate.
  * The third is the inventory (composed of normal-type objects).
  * Rather than equipment other players would never interact with, it only comprises the contents of the five holster slots.<br>
  * <br>
  * If this player is spawned as dead - with their `health` at 0% - he will start standing and then immediately fall into a lying pose.
  * The death pose selected is randomized, can not be influenced, and is not be shared across clients.
  * @param appearance the player's cardinal appearance settings
  * @param health the amount of health the player has, as a percentage of a filled bar;
  *               the bar has 85 states, with 3 points for each state;
  *               when 0% (less than 3 of 255), the player will collapse into a death pose on the ground
  * @param armor the amount of armor the player has, as a percentage of a filled bar;
  *              the bar has 85 states, with 3 points for each state
  * @param uniform_upgrade the level of upgrade to apply to the player's base uniform
  * @param command_rank the player's command rank as a number from 0 to 5;
  *                     cosmetic armor associated with the command rank will be applied automatically
  * @param implant_effects the effects of implants that can be seen on a player's character;
  *                        though many implants can be used simultaneously, only one implant effect can be applied here
  * @param cosmetics optional decorative features that are added to the player's head model by console/chat commands;
  *                  they become available at battle rank 24, but here they require the third uniform upgrade (rank 25);
  *                  these flags do not exist if they are not applicable
  * @param inventory the avatar's inventory;
  *                  typically, only the tools and weapons in the equipment holster slots
  * @param drawn_slot the holster that is initially drawn;
  *                   defaults to `DrawnSlot.None`
  * @see `CharacterAppearanceData`
  * @see `DetailedCharacterData`
