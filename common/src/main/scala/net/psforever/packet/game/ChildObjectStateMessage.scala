/**
  * Dispatched from a client when its user is controlling a secondary object whose state must be updated.<br>
  * <br>
  * When `ChildObjectStateMessage` is being sent to the server, it replaces `PlayerStateMessage`.
  * The packet frequently gets hidden in a `MultiPacket`, though it is not functionally essential to do that.<br>
  * <br>
  * Note the lack of position data.
  * The secondary object in question is updated in position through another means or is stationary.
  * The only concern is the direction the object is facing.
  * The angles are relative to the object's normal forward-facing and typically begin tracking at 0, 0 (forward-facing).
  * @param object_guid the object being manipulated (controlled)
  * @param pitch the angle with respect to the sky and the ground towards which the object is directed;
  *              an 8-bit unsigned value;
  *              0 is perfectly level and forward-facing and mapped to 255;
  *              positive rotation is downwards from forward-facing
  * @param yaw the angle with respect to the horizon towards which the object is directed;
  *            an 8-bit unsigned value;
  *            0 is forward-facing, wrapping around at 127;
  *            positive rotation is counter-clockwise of forward-facing
